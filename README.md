🔥 Features:

🏥 Instant CTAS Prediction – Get real-time triage levels based on patient data

📊 Vital Signs Input – Supports HR, BP, RR, Temp, and O2 saturation

📝 Chief Complaint Mapping – Uses simple complaint categories for prediction

🤖 AI-Powered – Machine learning model trained on real triage cases

⚡ Fast & User-Friendly – Minimal input required for quick results

🚀 How It Works:

Enter patient vital signs (HR, BP, RR, Temp, O2 sat)

Select a chief complaint category

Get an immediate CTAS level prediction

This project is designed for emergency departments, paramedics, and urgent care centers to enhance decision-making and reduce triage time.
