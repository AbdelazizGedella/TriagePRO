**Triage PRO** 🚑

- An AI-powered triage system for immediate CTAS prediction


Triage PRO is a fast and intelligent triage tool that predicts the Canadian Triage and Acuity Scale (CTAS) level based on patient vital signs and a few key chief complaint details. It helps healthcare providers make quick, data-driven decisions in emergency settings.

**🔥 Features:**

- 🏥 Instant CTAS Prediction – Get real-time triage levels based on patient data

- 📊 Vital Signs Input – Supports HR, BP, RR, Temp, and O2 saturation

- 📝 Chief Complaint Mapping – Uses simple complaint categories for prediction

- 🤖 AI-Powered – Machine learning model trained on real triage cases

- ⚡ Fast & User-Friendly – Minimal input required for quick results

**🚀 How It Works:**

- Enter patient vital signs (HR, BP, RR, Temp, O2 sat)

- Select a chief complaint category

- Get an immediate CTAS level prediction

**This project is designed for emergency departments, paramedics, and urgent care centers to enhance decision-making and reduce triage time.**

🔗 [Coming Soon]: Web & mobile integration, API support



# TriagePRO: AI-Powered Immediate CTAS Prediction for Emergency Care

## Overview
TriagePRO is an AI-driven system designed to predict the Canadian Triage and Acuity Scale (CTAS) level swiftly, utilizing patient vital signs and key chief complaint details. This tool aids healthcare providers in making rapid, data-informed decisions in emergency settings.

## Features
- **Instant CTAS Prediction**: Provides real-time triage levels based on patient data.
- **Comprehensive Vital Signs Input**: Accepts heart rate (HR), blood pressure (BP), respiratory rate (RR), temperature (Temp), and oxygen saturation (O2 sat).
- **Chief Complaint Categorization**: Utilizes straightforward complaint categories to enhance prediction accuracy.
- **AI-Powered Analysis**: Employs a machine learning model trained on actual triage cases to ensure reliable predictions.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Designed for rapid data entry, facilitating quick and efficient triage assessments.

## How It Works
1. **Enter Patient Data**: Input vital signs (HR, BP, RR, Temp, O2 sat).
2. **Select Chief Complaint**: Choose from predefined complaint categories.
3. **Get CTAS Prediction**: The AI model processes the data and provides an immediate CTAS level recommendation.

## Installation
